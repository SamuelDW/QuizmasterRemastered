INTRODUCTION 
----------------------------------------------
This is a remaster/upgraded version of my dissertation project "Quizmaster". The original project, whilst successful needed some improvements and changes to improve usability, namely some technology behind the scenes, and some user interface/experience changes. As well added features that were unable to be completed on time. Other aspects such as project management will be included, such as version control, and improvements to directory structure


 CHANGES
 --------------------------------------------
 Several changes have been made to improve functionality and ease of maintinging code.
 The first most major change is in home.php, where the repeated HMTL markup has been replaced with a 
 php loop, with an array just holding intial names of the pages, with the file extension appended
 
 The next change was in profile.php
